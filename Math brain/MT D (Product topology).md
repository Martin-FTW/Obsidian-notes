# Definition (Product topology)
Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces.
The product topology on $X\times Y$ is defined as the topology generated by the basis $\mathscr{B}=\set{U\times V\given U\subset X,V\subset Y\text{ are open}}$

Note that $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis since $(U_{1}\times V_{1})\cap (U_{2}\times V_{2})=(U_{1}\cap U_{2})\times(V_{1}\cap V_{2})\in \mathscr{B}$
See [[MT D (Box topology, product topology)]] for generalization.
