# Proposition 2.4.3 (Inverse function theorem on surfaces)
Let $S_{1},S_{2}$ be regular surfaces.
Let $U$ be open in $S_{1}$ and $p\in U$.
Let $f:U\to S_{2}$ be differentiable.
Suppose $df_{p}:T_{p}S_{1}\to T_{f(p)}S_{2}$ is an isomorphism.
Then $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at $p$, i.e.
- $\exists$ nbhd $V$ of $p$ in $U$ s.t. $f:V\to f(V)$ is a diffeomorphism.
