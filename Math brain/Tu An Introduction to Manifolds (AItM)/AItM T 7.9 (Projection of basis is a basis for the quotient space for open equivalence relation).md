# Theorem 7.9 (Projection of basis is a basis for the quotient space for open equivalence relation)
Let $S$ be a topological space and $\sim$ be an open equivalence relation on $S$.
Denote by $\pi:S\to S/{\sim}$ its open projection map.
Let $\mathscr{B}=\set{B_{\alpha}}$ be a basis for $S$.
Then $\pi^{\to \to}(\mathscr{B})=\set{\pi^{\to}(B_{\alpha})}$ is a basis for $S/{\sim}$
