# Definition (Frame, smooth frame)
Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a vector bundle.
Let $U\subseteq M$ be open.
Let $s_{1},\dots,s_{r}:U\to E$ be sections over $U$.
We call $\set{s_{1},\dots,s_{r}}$ a *frame over $U$* if $\forall p\in U:\set{s_{1}(p),\dots,s_{r}(p)}$ is a basis for the fiber $E_{p}\coloneqq\pi ^{-1}(p)$.
We call the frame $s_{1},\dots,s_{r}$ smooth if $s_{1},\dots,s_{r}$ are smooth sections of $E$ over $U$
A frame for the tangent bundle $TM\to M$ over an open set $U$ is simply called a *frame on $U$*.
