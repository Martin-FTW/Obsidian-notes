# Definition 8.22 (Critical and regular points and values of a smooth map between manifolds)
Let $N,M$ be manifolds and $p\in N,q\in M$.
Let $F:N\to M$ be a smooth map.
We call:
1. $p$ a critical point of $F$ if $F_{*,p}$ is not surjective
2. $p$ a regular point of $F$ if $p$ is not a critical point of $F$
3. $q$ a critical value of $F$ if $q$ is the image of a critical point
4. $q$ a regular value of $F$ if $q$ is not the image of a critical point

Note that 
1. $q$ is a regular value iff either $q$ is an image of a regular value or $q$ is not in  the image of $F$.
2. $q$ is a critical value iff $\exists p\in F^{-1}(\set{q})$ s.t. $p$ is a critical point of $F$
3. $q$ is a regular value iff $\forall p\in F^{-1}(\set{q})$, $p$ is a regular point of $F$
