# Definition (Change of curve orientation)
Let $\alpha:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a curve pbal.
Then the curve $\beta:(-b,-a)\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ defined by $\beta(s)=\alpha(-s)$ for all $s\in (a,b)$ has the same trace as $\alpha$ but in the opposite direction.
We say that $\alpha,\beta$ differ by a change of orientation.
