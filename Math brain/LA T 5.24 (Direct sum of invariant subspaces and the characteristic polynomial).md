# Theorem 5.24 (Direct sum of invariant subspaces and the characteristic polynomial)
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$.
Suppose $V=\oplus W_{i}$, where $W_{i}$ is a $T$-invariant subspace of $V$ for each $i\in\ii{1}{k}$.
Let $f_{i}(t)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $T_{W_{i}}$.
Then $\prod f_{i}$ is the characteristic polynomial of $T$.
