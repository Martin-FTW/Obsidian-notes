# Definition (Borel sigma-algebra, F-sigma, G-delta, Borel sets, Borel hierarchy)
Let $(X,\uptau)$ be a topological space.
We call $\mathcal{B}(X)\coloneqq \sigma(\uptau)$ the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $X$.
The members of $\mathcal{B}(X)$ are called Borel sets.
- A countable intersection of open sets is called a $G_{\delta}$-set.
- A countable union of closed sets is called an $F_{\sigma}$-set
- A countable union of $G_{\delta}$-sets is called a $G_{\delta \sigma}$-set
- A countable intersection of $F_{\sigma}$-sets is called an $F_{\sigma \delta}$ set
