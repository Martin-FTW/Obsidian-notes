# Definition (Diagonalizability)
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space.
Let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$.
Then $T$ is called diagonalizable if $\exists$ ordered basis $\beta$ for $V$ s.t. $[T]_{\beta}$ is diagonal.

A squaer matrix $A$ is called diagonalizable if $L_{A}$ is diagonalizable.
