# Definition (Critical point, regular value)
Let $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be open and $F:U\to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be differentiable.
We say that $p\in U$ is a critical point of $F$ if the following equivalent statements hold:
- $dF|_{p}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is not surjective.
- $\nabla F|_{p}=\vec{0}$.

The image $F(p)\in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ of a critical point $p\in U$ of $F$ is called a critical value of $F$.
A point of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ that is not a critical value is called a regular value of $F$.
Note that $a$ is a regular value of $F$
