# Definition (Eigenvector, eigenvalue)
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a vector space $V$ over a field $F$.
$v\in V\setminus \set{0}$ is called an eigenvector of $T$ if $\exists \lambda\in F:T(v)=\lambda v$.
In this case, $\lambda$ is called the eigenvalue corresponding to $v$.

Let $A\in M_{n\times n}(F)$. Then $v\in F^{n}\setminus \set{0}$ is called an eigenvector of $A$ if $v$ is an eigenvector of $L_A$.
In this case, the $\lambda\in F$ s.t. $Av=L_{A}(v)=\lambda v$ is called the eigenvalue of $A$ corresponding to $v$.
