# Definition (Path, path-connectedness)
Let $X$ be a topological space and $x,y\in X$.
A path in $X$ is defined as a continuous $f:\clcl{a}{b}\subset \mathbb{R}\to X$ s.t. $f(a)=x,f(b)=y$

We call $X$ path connected if every pair of points of $X$ can be joined by a path in $X$.
Note that path connectedness implies connectedness
