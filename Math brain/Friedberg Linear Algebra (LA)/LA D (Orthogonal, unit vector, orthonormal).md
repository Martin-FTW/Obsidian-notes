# Definition (Orthogonal, unit vector, orthonormal)
Let $V$ be an inner product space.
Let $x,y\in V$ and $S\subseteq V$.
- $x,y$ said to be orthogonal if $\innerp{x}{y}{}=0$.
- $S$ is said to be orthogonal if $\forall x,y\in S$, $x,y$ are orthogonal
- $x$ is called a unit vector if $\norm{x}=1$.
- $S$ is said to be orthonormal if $S$ is orthogonal and consist of only unit vectors.
