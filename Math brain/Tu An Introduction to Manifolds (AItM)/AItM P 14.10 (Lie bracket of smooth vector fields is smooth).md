# Proposition 14.10 (Lie bracket of smooth vector fields is smooth)
Let $M$ be a manifold, $X,Y$ be smooth vector fields on $M$.
Then $[X,Y]$ is a smooth vector field on $M$.
#### Proof
By [[AItM P 14.3 (Smoothness of a vector field in terms of functions)]], it suffices to check that $\forall f\in C^{\infty}(M):[X,Y]f$ is smooth.
Since $[X,Y]f=(XY-YX)f$ and $XYf,YXf$ are smooth, we have $[X,Y]f$ is smooth.
