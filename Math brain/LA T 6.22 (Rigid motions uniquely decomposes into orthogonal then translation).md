# Theorem 6.22 (Rigid motions uniquely decomposes into orthogonal then translation)
Let $f:V\to V$ be a rigid motion on an $n$-dimensional real inner product space $V$.
Then $\exists!g,T:V\to V$ s.t. $T$ is orthogonal operator, $g$ is a translation, and $f=g\circ T$.
That is, identifying $V\cong \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\exists!A\in O(n)$ and $v_{0}\in V$ s.t. $f(x)=Ax+v_{0}$.
