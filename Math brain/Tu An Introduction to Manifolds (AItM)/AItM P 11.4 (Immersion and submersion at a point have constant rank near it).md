# Proposition 11.4 (Immersion and submersion at a point have constant rank near it)
Let $N,M$ be manifolds of dimensions $n,m$ respectively.
Let $p\in N$ and $f:N\to M$ be a smooth map.
- If $f$ is an immersion at $p$, then $f$ has constant rank $n$ in a nbhd of $p$
- If $f$ is a submersion at $p$, then $f$ has constant rank $m$ in a nbhd of $p$
