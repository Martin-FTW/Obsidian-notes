# Proposition 9.4 (Atlas for regular submanifold)
Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $n$
Let $S$ be a regular submanifold of $N$ with localy vanishing $n-k$ coordinates.
Let $\mathfrak{U}=\set{(U,\phi)}$ be a collection of compatible adapted charts of $N$ that covers $S$.
Then $\set{(U\cap S,\phi_{S})}$ is an atlas for $S$.
Thus $S$ is a manifold of dimension $k$.
