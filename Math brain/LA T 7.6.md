# Theorem 7.6
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a vector space $V$.
Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $T$.
Suppose $\gamma_{1},\dots,\gamma_{q}$ are cycles of generalized eigenvectors of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$ s.t. the initial vectors of $\gamma_{i}$ are distinct and form a linearly independent set.
Then $\gamma_{1},\dots,\gamma_{q}$ are pairwise disjoint and $\gamma=\cup \gamma_{i}$ is linearly independent.
## Corollary
Every cycle of generalized eigenvectors of a linear operator is linearly independent.
