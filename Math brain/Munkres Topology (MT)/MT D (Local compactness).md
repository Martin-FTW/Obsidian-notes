# Definition (Local compactness)
Let $X$ be a topological space and $x\in X$.
We call $X$ locally compact at $x$ if the following equivalent statements hold:
- $\exists$ compact nbhd $C$ of $p$ in $X$, i.e. 
- $\exists$ compact subspace $C$ of $X$ that contains an open nbhd of $x$, i.e.
- $\exists$ compact subspace $C$ of $X$ and $\exists$ open nbhd $U$ of $p$ s.t. $U\subseteq C$.

We call $X$ locally compact if $\forall x\in X:X$ is locally compact at $x.$
