# Theorem 6.34 (Matrix representations of a bilinear form is symmetric iff its symmetric)
Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space.
Let $H\in \mathcal{B}(V)$ and $\beta$ be an ordered basis for $V$.
Then $H$ is symmetric iff $\psi_{\beta}(H)$ is symmetric.
## Corollary
If $H$ is diagonalizable, then $H$ is symmetric.
