# Definition 7.2 (Real analytic)
Let $f:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}$ be a function.
$f$ is said to be real analytic if $\forall c\in(a,b):\exists \delta>0$ and a power series $\sum a_{k}(x-c)^{k}$ s.t. $\forall x\in(c-\delta,c+\delta)\subseteq (a,b):f(x)=\sum a_{k}(x-c)^{k}$ 

Note that a real analytic function must uniquely define its power series, which is equal to its taylor series
