# Definition 15.8 (Lie subgroup)
Let $G$ be a Lie group and $H\subseteq G$.
We call $H$ a Lie subgroup of $G$ if
1. $H\leq G$
2. $H$ is an immersed submanifold of $G$ via the inclusion map
3. The group operations on $H$ are smooth

Note that $H$ may not have the subspace topology from $G$ as it is immersed but not embedded, but nonetheless the inclusion $i:H\to G$ is still smooth as it is an immersion.
If $H$ were defined to be a regular submanifold of $G$, then the group operations would be automatically smooth, thus condition 3 would be redundant.
