# Theorem 2.32 (dimension of order of differential operators)
Let $p(D)$ be a differential operator of order $n$.
Then $N(p(D))$ is an $n$-dimensional subspace of $C^{\infty}$.
## Lemma 1
$D-cI:C^{\infty}\to C^{\infty}$ is onto for any $c\in \mathbb{C}$.
## Lemma 2
Let $V$ be a vector space and $T,U$ be linear operators on $V$.
Suppose $U$ is onto and $N(T),N(U)$ are finite-dimensional.
Then $N(TU)$ is finite-dimensional and $\dim N(TU)=\dim N(T)+\dim N(U)$.
## Corollary
The solution space of any $n$-th order HLODE with constant coef is an $n$-dimensional subspace of $C^{\infty}$.
