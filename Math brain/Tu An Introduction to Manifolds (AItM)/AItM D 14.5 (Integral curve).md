# Definition 14.5 (Integral curve)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $p\in M$.
Let $X$ be a smooth vector field on $M$.
Let $c:\opop{a}{b}\to M$ be a smooth curve.
We call $c$ an *integral curve of $X$* if $c'(t)=X_{c(t)}$ for all $t\in \opop{a}{b}$.
Further suppose $0\in \opop{a}{b}$ and $c(0)=p$.
In this case, we say that $c$ is an integral curve *starting at $p$* and we call $p$ the *initial point of $c$*.
Sometimes we denote $c_{t}(p)$ instead of $c(t)$
