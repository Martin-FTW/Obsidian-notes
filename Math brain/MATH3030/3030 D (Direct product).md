# Definition (Direct product)
Let $H,K$ be groups.
Define a binary operation on $H\times K$ by $((h,k),(h',k'))\mapsto(hh',kk')$.
Then $H\times K$ is a group under this operation.
We call this group the direct roduct of $H,K$.

More generally, if we have $G_{1},\dots,G_{n}$ are groups, we can define a binary operation on $\prod G_{i}$ by component-wise group-operations.
Then $\prod G_{i}$ is a group called the direct product of $G_{1},\dots,G_{n}$.
If $G_{i}$ is abelian for all $i$, then we call $\prod G_{i}$ the direct sum of $G_{1},\dots,G_{n}$, denoted by $\bigoplus G_{i}$.
