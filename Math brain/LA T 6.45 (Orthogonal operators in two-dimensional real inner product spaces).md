# Theorem 6.45 (Orthogonal operators in two-dimensional real inner product spaces)
Let $V$ be a real inner product space with $\dim V=2$.
Let $T$ be an orthogonal operator on $V$.
Then $T$ is a rotation or $T$ is a reflection.
Furthermore, 
- $T$ is a rotation iff $\det T=1$
- $T$ is a reflection iff $\det T=-1$
## Corollary
The composite of a reflection on $V$ and a rotation on $V$ is a reflection on $V$.
