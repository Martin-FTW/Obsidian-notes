# Definition (Homeomorphism)
Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces.
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a bijection.
We call $f$ is a homeomorphism if both $f,f^{-1}$ are continuous.
This is equivalent to the statement 
- $\forall U\subseteq X:(U$ is open $\iff f(U)$ is open$)$.

If a property of $X$ is entirely expressed in terms of open sets of $X$, it yields a correesponding property for $Y$ via the homeomorphism $f$. We call these topological properties.
