# Definition (Subspace topology)
Let $(X,\mathscr{T})$ be a topological space.
Let $Y\subset X$.
Then the set $\mathscr{T}_{Y}=\set{Y\cap U\given U\in \mathscr{T}}$ is called the subspace topology on $Y$.

In this case, we say that a set $U$ is open in $Y$ if it belongs to the subspace topology for $Y$, and open in $X$ if it belongs to the topology of $X$.
