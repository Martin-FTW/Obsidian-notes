# Proposition 16.10 (Commutative diagram between the Lie bracket of tangent space at identity and left-invariant vector fields)
Let $G$ be a Lie group, $A,B\in T_{e}G$.
Let $\tilde{A},\tilde{B}$ be the left-invariant vector fields they generate.
Then $\lie{\tilde{A}}{\tilde{B}}=\lie{A}{B}\tilde{\ }$ .
#### Proof
By definition, we have $\lie{A}{B}=\lie{\tilde{A}}{\tilde{B}}_{e}$.
Applying $()\ \tilde{{}}$ i.e. $\varphi$ on both sides, we have $\lie{A}{B}\ \tilde{{}}=\lie{\tilde{A}}{\tilde{B}}_{e}\tilde{\ }=\lie{\tilde{A}}{\tilde{B}}$.
