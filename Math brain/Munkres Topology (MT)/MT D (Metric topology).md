# Definition (Metric topology)
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space.
Then $\set{B(x,\epsilon)\given x\in X,\epsilon>0}$ is a basis.
The generated topology is called the metric topology induced by $d$.
This topology is characterized by $U\subset X$ is open iff
- $\forall y\in U:\exists \delta>0:B_{d}(y,\delta)\subset U$.
