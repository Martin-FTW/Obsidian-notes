# Proposition 17.12 (Pullback of a smooth 1-form is a smooth 1-form)
Let $N,M$ be manifolds.
Let $F:N\to M$ be smooth and $\omega\in \Omega^{1}(M)$ be a smooth $1$-form on $M$.
Then $F\pullback \omega\in \Omega^{1}(N)$ is a smooth $1$-form on $N$.
That is, we have $F\pullback:\Omega^{1}(M)\to \Omega^{1}(N)$.
#### Proof
