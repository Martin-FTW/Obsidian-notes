# Definition (Dual space, covector)
Let $V,W$ be vector spaces over $\mathbb{R}$.
The dual space of $V$ is defined to be $V\dual\coloneqq\hom(V,\mathbb{R})$.
The elements of $V\dual$ are called $1$-covectors, or just covectors, on $V$.
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and let $\set{e_{i}}$ be a basis for $V$.
Then we can write $v=\sum v^{i}e_{i}$ for any $v\in V$
Denote the dual basis of $\set{e_{i}}$ by $\set{\alpha ^{i}}$, where $\alpha ^{i}(v)=v^{i}$ and $\alpha ^{i}(e_{j})=\delta ^{i}_{j}$
