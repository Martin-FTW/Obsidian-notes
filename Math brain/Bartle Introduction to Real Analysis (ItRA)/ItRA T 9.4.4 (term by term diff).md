# Theorem 9.4.4 (term by term diff)
Let $f_{n}:\clcl{a}{b}\to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable functions.
Suppose $\exists c\in\clcl{a}{b}:\left( \sum f_{n}(c) \right)$ is convergent
Suppose $\sum f_{n}'\rightrightarrows g$ on $\clcl{a}{b}$.
Then $\sum f_{n}\rightrightarrows f$ on $\clcl{a}{b}$ with $f'=g=\sum f_{n}'$.
