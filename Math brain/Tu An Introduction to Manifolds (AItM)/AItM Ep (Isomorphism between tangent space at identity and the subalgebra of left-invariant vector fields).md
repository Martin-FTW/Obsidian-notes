# Exposition (Isomorphism between tangent space at identity and the subalgebra of left-invariant vector fields)
Let $G$ be a Lie group.

The left-invariant vector fields $L(G)$ has a natural structure of Lie algebra as a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{X}(G)$ by [[AItM P 16.9 (Lie bracket of left-invariant vector fields is left-invariant)]].
The isomorphism $\varphi:T_{e}G\iso L(G)$ defined in [[AItM D (Left-invariant vector field)]] can carry the Lie bracket on $L(G)$ to $T_{e}G$ defined in [[AItM D (Lie bracket on tangent space at identity)]]

On the other hand, The tangent space $T_{e}G$ has a natural pushforward given by the differential of a Lie group homomorphism.
The same isomorphism $\varphi:T_{e}G\iso L(G)$ can carry the pushforward to the left-invariant vector fields by the differential of a Lie group homomorphism, defined in [[AItM D 16.12 (Pushforward of a left-invariant vector field by a Lie group homomorphism)]]
