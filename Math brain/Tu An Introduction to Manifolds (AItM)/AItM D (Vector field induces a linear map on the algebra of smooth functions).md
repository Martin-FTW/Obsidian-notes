# Definition (Vector field induces a linear map on the algebra of smooth functions)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $X$ be a vector field on $M$.
Define $X:C^{\infty}(M)\to C^{\infty}(M)$ by $(Xf)(p)=X_{p}f$ for all $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$ and $p\in M$.
Then this map is a linear operator on the algebra $C^{\infty}(M)$.
Note that this is also a derivation of the algebra $C^{\infty}(M)$ as $X(fg)=(Xf)g+f(Xg)$ with a similar proof to [[AItM P 2.6 (Leibniz rule for vector field)]]
