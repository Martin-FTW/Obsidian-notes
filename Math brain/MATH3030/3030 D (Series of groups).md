# Definition (Series of groups)
Let $G$ be a group and denote $1\coloneqq\set{e}$
- We call a finite chain: $1=H_{0}<H_{1}<\cdots<H_{n}=G$ a series of groups.
- If a series $1=H_{0}<H_{1}<\cdots<H_{n}=G$ satisfies $\forall i:H_{i}\lhd H_{i+1}$ then we say that the series is subnormal.
- If a subnormal series $1=H_{0}\lhd H_{1}\lhd \cdots\lhd H_{n}=G$ satisfies $\forall i:H_{i}\lhd G$ then we say the series is normal.

In any subnormal series, we call $\set{H_{i+1}/H_{i}}_{i}$ the factor groups of the series.
