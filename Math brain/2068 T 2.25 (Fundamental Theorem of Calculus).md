# Theorem 2.25 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)
Let $f\in R[a,b]$.
1. Suppose $\exists F:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $F$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $F'=f$.
Then $\int_{a}^{b}f=F(b)-F(a)$
2. The function $F:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $F(x)=\int_{a}^{x}f$ is continuous
If $f$ is cts then $F$ is diff on $(a,b)$ and $F'=f$
