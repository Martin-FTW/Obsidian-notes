# Definition (Multilinear, tensors)
Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$.
Let $f:V^{k}\to \mathbb{R}$.
We call $f$ $k$-linear if it is linear in each of its arguments, i.e. $\forall a,b\in \mathbb{R},v,w\in V$, $f(\dots,av+bw,\dots)=af(\dots,v,\dots)+bf(\dots,w, \dots)$
A $k$-linear function on $V$ is also called a $k$-tensor on $V$, where $k$ is called the degree of the tensor $f$.
The vector space of all $k$-tensors on $V$ is denoted $L_{k}(V)$.
