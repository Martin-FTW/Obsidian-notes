# Definition (Separation, connectedness)
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$.
A separation of $Y$ in $X$ is defined as a pair of disjoint nonempty sets $A,B$ where $A\cup B=Y$ and each of $A,B$ do not contain any limit point of the other set.

If $X=Y$, we have the following equivalent definition:
A separation of $X$ is defined as a pair of disjoint nonempty open subsets $U,V$ where $U\cup V=X$

We call $X$ connected if the following equivalent statements hold:
- $X$ has no separations
- The only clopen sets in $X$ are $\emptyset,X$
