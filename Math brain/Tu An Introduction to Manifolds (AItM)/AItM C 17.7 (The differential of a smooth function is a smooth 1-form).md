# Corollary 17.7 (The differential of a smooth function is a smooth 1-form)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$.
Then $df$ is a smooth $1$-form on $M$, i.e. $df\in \Omega^{1}(M)$
#### Proof
Let $(U,\phi)=(U,x^{1},\dots,x^{n})$ be a chart on $M$.
Note that $\frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x^{i} }$ are all smooth on $M$.
Thus from $df=\sum \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x^{i} }dx^{i}$, we have $df$ is smooth by [[AItM P 17.6 (Smoothness of a 1-form in terms of coefficients)]]
