# Theorem 2.34 (Basis of solution space for HLODE with constant coef)
Let a homogeneous HLODE with constant coefficients have auxiliary polynomial $p=\displaystyle \prod_{k=1}^{n}(t-c_{k})^{n_{k}}$, where $c_{k}\in \mathbb{C}$ are distinct and $n_{k}\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.
Then $\displaystyle \bigcup_{k=1}^{n}\set*{t^{j}e^{c_{k}t}}_{j=0}^{n_{k}-1}$ is a basis for its solution space.
## Lemma
Let $c\in \mathbb{C},n\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.
Suppose $(t-c)^{n}$ is the auxiliary polynomial of a HLODE with constant coef. 
Then $\beta=\set{t^{j}e^{ct}}_{j=0}^{n-1}$ is a basis for its solution space
