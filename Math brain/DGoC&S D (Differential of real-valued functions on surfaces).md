# Definition (Differential of real-valued functions on surfaces)
Let $S$ be a regular surface and $p\in S$.
Let $f:S\to \mathbb{R}$.
The differential of $f$ is the linear transofrmation $df_{p}:T_{p}S\to \mathbb{R}$ defined by
- $\forall v\in T_{p}S:df_{p}(v)=\left.\dfrac{d(f\circ \alpha)}{dt}\right\vert_{t=0}$ where $\alpha$ is any curve given in the definition of $T_{p}S$.
