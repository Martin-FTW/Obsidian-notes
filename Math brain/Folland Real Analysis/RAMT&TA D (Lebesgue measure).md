# Definition (Lebesgue measure)
Let $\mu:\mathcal{M}_{\mu}\to \clcl{0}{\infty}$ the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure associated to $\id_{\mathbb{R}}$, i.e. the function $F(x)=x$.
We call $\mu$ the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$.
We denote
- $m=\mu$ for the measure
- $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{M}_{\mu}$ for the class of Lebesgue measurable sets
