# Definition (Faithful, transitive action)
Let $G$ be act on $X$.
We say that the action is faithful if $(\forall x\in X:gx=x)\implies g=e$, i.e. the induced group homomorphism $\rho:G\to S_{X}$ is injective.
We say that the action is transitive if $\forall x_{1},x_{2}\in X:\exists g\in G:x_{2}=gx_{1}$.
