# Proposition 12.3 (The tangent bundle of a manifold is second-countable)
#### Proof
By [[AItM L 12.2 (Every manifold has a countable basis consisting of coordinate open sets)]], let $\set{U_{i}}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ be a countable basis for $M$ consisting of coordinate open sets, where $(U_{i},\phi _{i})$ are the corresponding charts.
Since $TU_{i}$ is homeomorphic to $\phi _{i}(U_{i})\times \mathbb{R}^{n}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and $\phi _{i}(U_{i})\times \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is second-countable, we have $TU_{i}$ is second-countable.
Now choose a countable basis $\set{B_{i,j}}_{j=1}^{\infty}$ for $TU_{i}$. Then $\set{B_{i,j}}_{i,j}$ is a countable basis for $TM$.
