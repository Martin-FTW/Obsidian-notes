# Definition (Germ on manifold)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $p\in M,X=\set{(f,U)\given U\text{ is  a nbhd of }p, f\in C^{\infty}(U)}$.
We define an equivalence relation $\sim$ by $(f,U)\sim(g,V)$ if $\exists$ nbhd $W\subseteq U\cap V$ of $p$ in $M$ s.t. $f|_{W}=g|_{W}$
The equivalence class $[(f,U)]_{\sim}$ is called the germ of $f$ at $p$ in $M$.
We denote $C_{p}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\coloneqq X/\sim$ for the quotient set.
Note that pointwise addition and multiplication, as well as scalar multiplication by $\mathbb{R}$ makes $C_{p}^{\infty}(M)$ an algebra over $\mathbb{R}$.
