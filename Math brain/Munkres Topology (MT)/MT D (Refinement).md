# Definition (Refinement)
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $\mathscr{A},\mathscr{B}\in \power(X)$ be collections of subset of $X$.
We say that $\mathscr{B}$ refines $\mathscr{A}$ if $\forall B\in \mathscr{B}:\exists A\in \mathscr{A}:B\subseteq A$.
If $\mathscr{B}$ contains only open sets, we call $\mathscr{B}$ an open refinement of $\mathscr{A}$
If $\mathscr{B}$ contains only closed sets, we call $\mathscr{B}$ an closed refinement of $\mathscr{A}$
