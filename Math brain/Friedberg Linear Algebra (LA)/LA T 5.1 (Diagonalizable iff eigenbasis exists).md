# Theorem 5.1 (Diagonalizable iff eigenbasis exists)
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$.
Then $T$ is diagonalizable iff $\exists$ ordered basis $\beta=\set{v_{j}}_{j=0}^{n}$ for $V$ consisting of eigenvectors of $T$.
In this case, $D\coloneqq[T]_{\beta}$ is a diagonal matrix and $D_{jj}$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to $v_{j}$.
