# Theorem 6.23 (Orthogonal operators in R2)
Let $T$ be an orthogonal operator on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
Let $A=[T]_{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is the standard ordered basis in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
Then exactly one of the following is satisfied:
1. $T$ is a rotation, and $\det A=1$
2. $T$ is a reflection about a line through the origin, and $\det A=-1$.

## Corollary
Any rigid motion on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is exactly one of the following:
1. a rotation followed by translation
2. a reflection about a line through the origin followed by translation
