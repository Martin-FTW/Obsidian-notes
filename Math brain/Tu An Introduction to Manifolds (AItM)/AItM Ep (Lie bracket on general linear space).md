# Exposition (Lie bracket on general linear space)
Note that $\GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ is a Lie group from [[AItM Eg 6.21 (General linear group as a Lie group)]].
We also have [[AItM Eg 8.19 (Differential of left multiplication in general linear group)]] and the identification $\displaystyle \sum a_{ij}\left.\frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_{ij} }\right\vert_{I}\leftrightarrow[a_{ij}]$ in [[AItM Eg 16.7 (Left-invariant vector fields on general linear space)]].
The tangent space $T_{I}\GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ with its Lie algebra structure is denoted by $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$, with its Lie bracket defined by $\lie{A}{B}=\lie{\tilde{A}}{\tilde{B}}_{I}$.
