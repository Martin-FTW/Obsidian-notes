# Definition (Fixed-point of group action)
Let $G$ act on $X$ and $g\in G$.
Define $X_{g}\coloneqq\set{x\in X\given gx=x}$ the subset of $X$ fixed by $g$.
We call elements of $X_{g}$ a fixed point of $g$, or that $g$ fixes $x$.
The set $\displaystyle  X_{G}\coloneqq\bigcap_{g\in G}X_{g}=\set{x\in X\given \forall g\in G:gx=x}$ is called the fixed points of the $G$-action.
