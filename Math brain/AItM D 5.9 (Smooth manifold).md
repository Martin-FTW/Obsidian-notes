# Definition 5.9 (Smooth manifold)
Let $M$ be a topological manifold.
We call $M$ a smooth manifold if $M$ has a maximal $C^{\infty}$-atlas $\mathfrak{M}$.
In this case, we call $\mathfrak{M}$ a differentiable structure on $M$.
say that $M$ has dimension $n$ if all its connected components have dimension $n$.
