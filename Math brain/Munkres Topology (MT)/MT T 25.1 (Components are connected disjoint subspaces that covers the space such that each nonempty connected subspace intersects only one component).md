# Theorem 25.1 (Components are connected disjoint subspaces that covers the space such that each nonempty connected subspace intersects only one component)
Let $X$ be a topological space and $\sim$ the "connected" equivalence relation.
Then $X/{\sim}=\set{C\given C\text{ is a component of }X}$ consist of connected disjoint subspaces of $X$ whose union is $X$.
For all nonempty connected subspace $S$ of $X$, $S$ intersects only $1$ of the components.
