# Definition (Arc length)
Let $\alpha:I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a regular parametrized curve.
Given $t_{0}\in I$, the arclength of $\alpha$ from $t_{0}$ is defined by $$s(t)=\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\norm{\alpha'(t)}\d t$$
Note that by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $s$ is differentiable and $$s'(t)=\norm{\alpha'(t)}$$
