# Definition (Identifying a subset to a point)
Let $S$ be a topological space and $A\subseteq S$.
Define a relation $\sim$ on $S$ by declaring $\forall x\in S:x\sim x$ and $\forall x,y\in A:x\sim y$.
This equivalence relation induces a quotient space $S/{\sim}$.
We say that $S/{\sim}$ is obtained by identifying $A$ to a point.
