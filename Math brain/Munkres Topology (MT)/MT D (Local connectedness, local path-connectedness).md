# Definition (Local connectedness, local path-connectedness)
Let $X$ be a topological space.
We say that $\forall x\in X:$
1. $X$ is locally connected at $x$ if $\forall$ nbhd $U$ of $x$, $\exists$ connected nbhd $C$ of $x$ in $U$
2. $X$ is locally path-connected at $x$ if $\forall$ nbhd $U$ of $x$, $\exists$ path-connected nbhd $P$ of $x$ in $U$.

We call $X$
1. locally connected if $\forall x\in X:X$ is locally connected at $x$
1. locally path-connected if $\forall x\in X:X$ is locally path-connected at $x$
