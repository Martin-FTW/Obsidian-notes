# Definition (Parametrization by arc length)
Let $\alpha:I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a regular curve.
We say that $\alpha$ is parametrized by arc-length (pbal) if $\norm{\alpha'(t)}\equiv 1$.
This means that $t$ is the arc-length from fixed $t_{0}$

Note that every regular curve admits an arc-length parametrization, and every curve pbal is regular.
