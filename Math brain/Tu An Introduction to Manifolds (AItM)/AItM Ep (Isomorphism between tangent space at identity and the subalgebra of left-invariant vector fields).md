# Exposition (Isomorphism between tangent space at identity and the subalgebra of left-invariant vector fields)
Let $G$ be a Lie group.
The tangent space $T_{e}G$ has a natural pushforward given by the differential of a Lie group homomorphism, while $L(G)$ has a natural structure of Lie algebra as a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{X}(G)$ by [[AItM P 16.9 (Lie bracket of left-invariant vector fields is left-invariant)]].
Note that the isomorphism $\varphi:T_{e}G\iso L(G)$ defined in [[AItM D (Left-invariant vector field)]] can carry the Lie bracket on $L(G)$ to $T_{e}G$:
$\forall A,B\in T_{e}G$, define $\lie{A}{B}\coloneqq \varphi ^{-1}(\lie{\varphi(A)}{\varphi(B)})=\lie{\tilde{A}}{\tilde{B}}_{e}$.
On the other hand, we can pushforward a left-invariant vector field by the differential of a Lie group homomorphism
