# Definition (Measurable function onto real and complex, Lebesgue measurable, Borel measurable)
Let $(X,\mathcal{M})$ be a measurable space.
Let $F=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.
Let $f:X\to F$ be a function.
We say that $f$ is $\mathcal{M}$-measurable if $f$ is $(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{B}_{F})$-measurable.
In particular, suppose $X=\mathbb{R}$
We call $f$ Lebesgue measurable if $f$ is $\mathcal{L}$-measurable.
We call $f$ Borel measurable if $f$ is $\mathcal{B}_{F}$-measurable
