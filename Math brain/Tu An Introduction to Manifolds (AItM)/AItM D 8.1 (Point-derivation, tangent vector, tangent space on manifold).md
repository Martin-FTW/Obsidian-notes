# Definition 8.1 (Point-derivation, tangent vector, tangent space on manifold)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $p \in M$.
Let $D:C_{p}^{\infty}(M)\to \mathbb{R}$ be a linear map.
We call $D$ a point-derivation of $C_{p}^{\infty}(M)$ or a derivation at $p$ in $M$ if $D(fg)=(Df)g(p)+f(p)Dg$.
We call a point-derivation at $p$ a tangent vector at $p$.
The set of all tangent vectors at $p$ is called the tangent space at $p$, denoted $T_{p}(M)$.
