# Proposition (Curvature and torsion for non-pbal regular curves)
Let $\alpha:I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a regular curve.
Define the curvature $k(t)$ and torsion $\uptau(t)$ by that of the arc-length reparameterization $\beta$ of $\alpha(I)$.
Then as functions of $t\in I$, we have
- $k=\dfrac{\norm{\alpha''\times \alpha'}}{\norm{\alpha'}^{3}}$
- $\uptau=\dfrac{\innerp{\alpha'''}{\alpha'\times \alpha''}{}}{\norm{\alpha'\times \alpha''}^{2}}$
