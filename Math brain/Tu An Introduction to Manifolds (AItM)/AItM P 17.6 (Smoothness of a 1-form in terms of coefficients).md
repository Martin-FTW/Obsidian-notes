# Proposition 17.6 (Smoothness of a 1-form in terms of coefficients)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $\omega$ be a $1$-form on $M$.
Then TFAE:
1. $\omega$ is smooth
2. $\exists$ atlas $\mathfrak{M}$ of $M$ s.t. $\forall (U,\phi)=(U,x^{1},\dots,x^{n})\in \mathfrak{M}$, the coefficients $a_{i}$ of $\omega=\sum a_{i}dx^{i}$ relative to the frame $dx^{i}$ are all smooth
3. $\forall$ chart $(U,\phi)=(U,x^{1},\dots,x^{n})$ on $M$, the coefficients $a_{i}$ of $\omega=\sum a_{i}dx^{i}$ relative to the frame $dx^{i}$ are all smooth.
