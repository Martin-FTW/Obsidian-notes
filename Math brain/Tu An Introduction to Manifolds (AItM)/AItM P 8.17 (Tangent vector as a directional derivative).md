# Proposition 8.17 (Tangent vector as a directional derivative)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $p\in M$.
Let $X_{p}\in T_{p}M$ and $f\in C_{p}^{\infty}(M)$.
Let $c:\opop{-\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}\to M$ be a smooth curve starting at $p$ with $c'(0)=X_{p}$.
Then $\displaystyle X_{p}f=(f\circ c)'(0)=\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right\vert_{0}(f\circ c)$.
