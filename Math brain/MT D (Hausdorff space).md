# Definition (Hausdorff space)
Let $X$ be a topological space.
We call $X$ a Hausdorff space if every two distinct points are separated by neighbourhoods, i.e. 
- $\forall$ distinct $x_{1},x_{2}\in X$, $\exists$ neighbourhoods $U_{1}$ of $x_{1}$, $U_{2}$ of $x_{2}$ s.t. $U_{1}\cap U_{2}=\emptyset$.
