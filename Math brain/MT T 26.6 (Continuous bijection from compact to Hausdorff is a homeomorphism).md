# Theorem 26.6 (Continuous bijection from compact to Hausdorff is a homeomorphism)
#### Proof
Let $f:X\to Y$ be a continuous bijection, where $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff.
Let $A$ be closed in $X$.
Since $X$ is compact, $A$ is compact.
Since $f$ is continuous, we have $f(A)$ is compact.
Since $Y$ is Hausdorff, we have $f(A)$ is closed in $Y$.
It follows that $f^{-1}$ is continuous.
