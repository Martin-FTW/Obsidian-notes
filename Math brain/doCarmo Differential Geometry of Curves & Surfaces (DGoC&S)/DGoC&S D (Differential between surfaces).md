# Definition (Differential between surfaces)
Let $S_{1},S_{2}$ be regular surfaces and $p\in S_{1}$.
Let $f:S_{1}\to S_{2}$ be a differentiable function.
The differential of $f$ is the linear transformation $df_{p}:T_{p}S_{1}\to T_{f(p)}S_{2}$ defined by
- $\forall v\in T_{p}S_{1}$, let $\alpha:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to S_{1}$ be any curve given in the definition of $T_{p}S_{1}$, and let $\beta=f\circ \alpha:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to S_{2}$ s.t. $\beta(0)=f(p)$, finally $df_{p}(v)\coloneqq\beta'(0)\in T_{f(p)}S_{2}$.
