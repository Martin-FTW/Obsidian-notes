# Theorem 5.9 (Diagonalizable iff mult are equal)
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$.
Suppose the characteristic polynomial of $T$ splits.
Let $\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{k}$ be all the distinct eigenvaleus of $T$.
Then $T$ is diagonalizable iff $\mu_{T}(\lambda_{i})=\dim E_{\lambda_{i}}$ for all $i$.
In this case, if $\beta_{i}$ is an ordered basis for $E_{\lambda_{i}}$, then $\beta=\concat \beta_{i}$ is an ordered basis for $V$ consisting of eigenvectors of $T$.
