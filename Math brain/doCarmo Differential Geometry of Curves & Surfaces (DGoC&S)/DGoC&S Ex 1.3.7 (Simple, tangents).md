# Exercise 1.3.7 (Simple, tangents)
A map $\alpha:I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is called a curve of class $C^{k}$ if $\alpha^{1},\alpha^{2},\alpha^{3}$ are $C^{k}$.
A curve $\alpha:I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is called simple if $\alpha$ is injective.
Let $\alpha:I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a simple $C^{0}$ curve and $t_{0}\in I$.
We say that $\alpha$ has a weak tangent at $t_{0}$ if the line joining $\alpha(t_{0}+h),\alpha(t_{0})$ has limit as $h\to 0$.
We say that $\alpha$ has a strong tangent at $t_{0}$ if the line joining $\alpha(t_{0}+h),\alpha(t_{0}+k)$ has limit as $k\to 0$.
