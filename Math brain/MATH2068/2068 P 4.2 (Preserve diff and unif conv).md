# Proposition 4.2 (Preserve diff and unif conv)
Let $f_{n}:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}$ be a seq of diff functions.
Suppose 
1. $\exists c\in(a,b):\lim(f_{n}(c))\in \mathbb{R}$
2. $f_{n}'\rightrightarrows g$ where $g:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}$.

Then $f_{n}\rightrightarrows f$ where $f:(a,b)\to \mathbb{R}$ is diff and $f'=g$.
