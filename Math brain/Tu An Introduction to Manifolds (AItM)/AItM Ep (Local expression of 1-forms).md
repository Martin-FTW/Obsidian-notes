# Exposition (Local expression of 1-forms)
Let $M$ be a manifold.
Let $\omega\in \Omega^{1}(M)$ be a $1$-form.
At each point $p\in M$ with a chart $(U,\phi)=(U,x^{1},\dots,x^{n})$ about $p$, we can express $\omega$ locally in $U$ by $\omega(p)=\sum a_{i}(p)(dx^{i})_{p}$, and hence $\omega=\sum a_{i}dx^{i}$, where $a_{i}:U\to \mathbb{R}$ are coefficient functions.
In particular, if $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, $\displaystyle df|_{U}=\sum a_{i}dx^{i}=\sum \frac{ \partial f}{ \partial x^{i} }dx^{i}$ by the usual trick of evaluating both sides on $\frac{ \partial }{ \partial x^{i} }$.
