# Theorem 7.5
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$.
Suppose the characteristic polynomial of $T$ splits.
Let $\beta$ be a basis for $V$ s.t. $\beta=\sqcup\gamma_{i}$, where each $\gamma_{i}$ is a cycle of generalized eigenvectors of $T$.
Then
1. $W\coloneqq\span(\gamma_{i})$ is $T$-invariant and $[T_{W}]_{\gamma_{i}}$ is a Jordan block $\forall i$
2. $\beta$ is a Jordan canonical basis for $V$
