# Theorem 26.2 (Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact)
#### Proof
Let $Y$ be a closed subspace of the compact space $X$.
Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a covering of $Y$ by sets open in $X$.
Then $\mathscr{A}\cup \set{X\setminus Y}$ is an open covering of $X$.
Since $X$ is compact, there is a finite subcover $\set{A_{i}}_{i=1}^{n}$ of $\mathscr{A}\cup \set{X\setminus Y}$.
Now $\set{A_{i}}_{i=1}^{n}\setminus \set{X\setminus Y}$ is a finite subcover of $\mathscr{A}$.
