# Theorem 2.33 (Distinct exponential functions are linearly independent)
Let $c_{1},\dots,c_{n}\in \mathbb{C}$ be distinct.
Then $\set{e^{c_{k}t}}_{k=1}^{n}$ is lienarly independent.
## Corollary
For any $n$-th order HLODE with constant coef, if the auxiliary polynomial has $n$ distinct zeros $c_{1},\dots,c_{n}$, then $\set{e^{c_{k}t}}_{k=1}^{n}$ is a basis for the solution space of the ODE.
