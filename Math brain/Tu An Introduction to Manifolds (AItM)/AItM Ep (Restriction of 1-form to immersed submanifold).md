# Exposition (Restriction of 1-form to immersed submanifold)
Let $M$ be a manifold.
Let $S\subseteq M$ be an immersed submanifold with inclusion $i:S\to M$.
At any $p\in S$, the differential $i\pushforward[,p]:T_{p}S\to T_{p}M$ is injective, thus we can identiy $T_{p}S$ as a subspace of $T_{p}M$.
Now let $\omega$ be a $1$-form on $M$.
Then the restriction of $\omega$ to $S$ is the $1$-form $\omega \vert_{S}$ defined by $(\omega \vert_{S})_{p}(v)=\omega_{p}(v)$ for all $p\in S,v\in T_{p}S$.
