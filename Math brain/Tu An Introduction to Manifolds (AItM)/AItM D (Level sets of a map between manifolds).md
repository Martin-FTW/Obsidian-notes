# Definition (Level sets of a map between manifolds)
Let $N,M$ be manifolds.
Let $F:N\to M$ and $c\in M$.
The level set of $F$ at level $c$ is defined by $F^{-1}(c)\coloneqq F^{-1}(\set{c})$.
If $c$ is a regular value of $F$, we call $F^{-1}(c)$ a regular level set.
If $M=\mathbb{R}^{m}$, then $Z(F)\coloneqq F^{-1}(\vec{0})$ is called the zero set of $F$.
If in addition $\vec{0}$ is a regular value of $F$, then $Z(F)$ is called a regular zero set.
