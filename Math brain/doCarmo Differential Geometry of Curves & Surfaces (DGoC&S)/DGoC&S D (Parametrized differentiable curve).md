# Definition (Parametrized differentiable curve)
Let $-\infty \leq a<b\leq \infty$ and $I=(a,b)\subseteq \mathbb{R}$.
Let $\alpha:I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a function.
We call $\alpha$ a parametrized differentiable curve if $\alpha$ is differentiable.
In this case,
- $\alpha'(t)$ is called the tangent vector of $\alpha$ at $t$
- $\alpha(I)$ is called the trace of $\alpha$
