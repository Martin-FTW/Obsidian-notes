# Definition (Countably locally finite, sigma-locally finite)
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $\mathscr{B}\subseteq \power(X)$ be a collection of subsets of $X$.
We call $\mathscr{B}$ countably locally finite or $\sigma$-locally finite if 
- $\exists$ countably many locally finite collections $\mathscr{B}_{n}$ of subsets of $X$ s.t. $\displaystyle \mathscr{B}=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathscr{B_{n}}$.
