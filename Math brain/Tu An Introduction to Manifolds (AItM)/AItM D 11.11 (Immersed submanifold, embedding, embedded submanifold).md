# Definition 11.11 (Immersed submanifold, embedding, embedded submanifold)
Let $N,M$ be manifolds.
Let $f:N\to M$ be smooth injective immersion.

1. We call $f(N)$ an immersed submanifold of $M$ if $f(N)$ has the topology inherited from $f$, i.e. $f(U)$ is open in $f(N)$ iff $U$ is open in $N$.

2. We call $f$ an embedding $f$ is a topological imbedding, i.e. $f(N)$ with the subspace topology is homeomorphic to $N$ under $f$.
In this case, we call $f(N)$ an embedded submanifold of $M$.
