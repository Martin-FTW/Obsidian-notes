# Exposition (Cyclic group, modular arithmetic)
Let $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.
Define the equivalence relation *congruence modulo $n$* on $\mathbb{Z}$ by $\forall a,b\in \mathbb{Z}:a\equiv b\mod n\iff n\divides b-a$.
The quotient set $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ has equivalence classes $[k]_{n}$
An operation $+$ can be defined on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ by $[a]+[b]=[a+b]$
This is well-defined by [[AC0 L II.2.2 (Addition is well-defined modulo n)]].
Note that $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},+)$ is an abelian group.
It is also cyclic with generator $[1]_{n}$, thus we write $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},+)\iso(C_{n},\cdot)$
