# Lemma 23.2 (Connected subspaces in disconnected spaces)
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let $C,D$ be a separation of $X$.
Let $Y$ be a connected subspace of $X$.
Then $Y\subset C$ or $Y\subset D$.
#### Proof
Consider $C\cap Y,D\cap Y$, both open in $Y$.
Note that they are disjoint and their union is $Y$.
If they were both nonempty, they would constitude a separation of $Y$.
It follows that one of them is empty.
Hence $Y$ is a subset of the other one.
