# Proposition 6.11 (Any diffeomorphism is a coordinate map of a chart in the differentiable structure)
Let $M$ be a manifold of dimension $n$.
Let $U\subseteq M$ be open.
Let $F:U\to F(U)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a diffeomorphism.
Then $(U,F)$ is a chart in the differentiable structure of $M$.
#### Proof
Let $(U_{\alpha},\phi_{\alpha})$ be a chart in the maximal atlas.
Then both $\phi_{\alpha},\phi_{\alpha}^{-1}$ are $C^{\infty}$ as they are coordinate maps.
Now $F\circ \phi_{\alpha}^{-1}$ and $\phi_{\alpha}\circ F^{-1}$ are $C^{\infty}$.
Hence $(U,F)$ is compatible with $(U_{\alpha},\phi_{\alpha})$, thus is compatible with the maximal atlas.
Since the atlas is maximal, $(U,F)$ is in the atlas.
