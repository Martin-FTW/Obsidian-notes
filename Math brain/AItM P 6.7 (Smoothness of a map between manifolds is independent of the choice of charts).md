# Proposition 6.7 (Smoothness of a map between manifolds is independent of the choice of charts)
Let $N,M$ be manifolds and $p\in N$.
Let $F:N\to M$ is $C^{\infty}$ at $p$
Let $(U,\phi)$ be a chart about $p$ in $N$ and $(V,\psi)$ be a chart about $F(p)$ in $M$.
Then $\psi \circ F\circ \phi ^{-1}$ is $C^{\infty}$ at $\phi(p)$.
