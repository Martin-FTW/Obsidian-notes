# Definition (Curvature, torsion)
## Space curve
Let $\alpha:I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a curve pbal with no singular points of order $1$.
We call
- $k(s)\coloneqq \norm{\alpha''(s)}=\norm{T'(s)}$ the curvature of $\alpha$ at $s$.
- $\uptau(s)\coloneqq\innerp{B'(s)}{N(s)}{}$ the torsion of $\alpha$ at $s$.

### Modern def
We call
- $k(s)\coloneqq \norm{\alpha''(s)}=\norm{T'(s)}$ the curvature of $\alpha$ at $s$.
- $\uptau(s)\coloneqq$ see [[DGoC&S T (Frenet equations)]]
  It follows that $\uptau(s)=\innerp{B(s)}{N'(s)}{}=\innerp{B'(s)}{N(s)}{}$ the torsion of $\alpha$ at $s$.
