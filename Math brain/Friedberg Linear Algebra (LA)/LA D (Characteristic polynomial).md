# Definition (Characteristic polynomial)
Let $A\in M_{n\times n}(F)$.
The polynomial $f(t)=\det(A-tI_{n})$ is called the characteristic polynomial of $A$.

Let $T$ be a linear operator on an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ with ordered basis $\beta$.
The characteristic polynomial $f(t)$ of $T$ is defined to be the characteristic polynomial of $[T]_{\beta}$.
That is, $f(t)=\det([T]_{\beta}-tI_{n})$.
Since $f$ is independent of $\beta$, we denote $f(t)=\det(T-t I)$.
