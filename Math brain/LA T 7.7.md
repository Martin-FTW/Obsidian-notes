# Theorem 7.7
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a vector space $V$.
Let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $T$.
Then $K_{\lambda}$ has an ordered basis consisting of a union of disjoint cycles of generalized eigenvectors corresponding to $\lambda$.
## Corollary 1
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then $T$ has a Jordan Canonical form.
## Corollary 2
Let $A$ be a square matrix whose characteristic polynomial splits.
Then $A$ has a Jordan canonical form $J$ and is similar to it.
