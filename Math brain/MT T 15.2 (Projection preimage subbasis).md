# Theorem 15.2 (Projection preimage subbasis)
Let $X\times Y$ have a product topology.
Then $S=\set{\pi_{1}^{-1}(U)\given U\text{ open in }X}\cup \set{\pi_{2}^{-1}(V)\given V\text{ open in }U}$ is a subbasis for the product topology on $X\times Y$.
#### Proof
Let $\mathscr{T}$ be the product topology on $X\times Y$
Let $\mathscr{T}'$ be the topology generated by $S$
Since every element of $S$ is in the form $U\times Y$ or $X\times V$, which are both open in the product topology, we have $\mathscr{T}'\subset \mathscr{T}$.
Now for any basis element $U\times V$ of the product topology, we have $U\times V=\pi_{1}^{-1}(U)\cap \pi_{2}^{-1}(V)$ is an intersection of elements in $S$.
Hence $U\times V\in \mathscr{T}'$, thus $\mathscr{T}\subset \mathscr{T}'$.
