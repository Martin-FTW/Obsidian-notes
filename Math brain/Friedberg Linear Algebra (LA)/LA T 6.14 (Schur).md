# Theorem 6.14 (Schur)
Let $T$ be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space $V$.
Suppose the characteristic polynomial of $T$ splits.
Then $\exists$ orthonormal basis $\beta$ for $V$ s.t. $[T]_{\beta}$ is upper triangular.
## Lemma
If $T$ has an eigenvector, then so does $T^{*}$
