# Definition (Short exact sequence)
Let $H,G,Q$ be groups and $1=\set{e}$. 
The sequence $1\to H\xrightarrow{\iota} G\xrightarrow{\pi} Q\to 1$ is called short exact if
- $\iota$ is injective
- $\pi$ is surjective
- $\ker \pi=\im \iota$

in this case, we also say $G$ is an extension of $Q$ by $H$.

Note that given a composition series $\set{H_{i}}$, every $i$ gives a short exact sequence $1\to H_{i}\to H_{i+1}\to H_{i+1}/H_{i}\to 1$.
