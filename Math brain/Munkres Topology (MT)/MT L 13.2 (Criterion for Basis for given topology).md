# Lemma 13.2 (Criterion for Basis for given topology)
Let $X$ be at opological space.
Suppose $\mathscr{C}$ is a collection of open sets of $X$ that satisfies:
- $\forall$ open $U$, $\forall x\in U$, $\exists C\in \mathscr{C}$ s.t. $x\in C\subset U$.

Then $\mathscr{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.
