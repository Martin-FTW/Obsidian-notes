# Definition (Quotient topology)
Let $X$ be a topological space and $A$ be a set.
Let $p:X\to A$ be a surjective function.
Then $\exists!$ topology $\mathscr{T}$ on $A$ s.t. $p$ is a quotient map on $\mathscr{T}$.
We call this the quotient tooplogy induced by $p$.

The topology is obtained by $\mathscr{T}=\set{U\subset A\given p ^{-1}(U)\text{ open in }X}$.
