# Definition (Lie bracket)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $U\subseteq M$ be open.
Let $X,Y$ be vector fields on $U$, thus derivations on $C^{\infty}(U)$.
Now for any $f\in C^{\infty}(U)$, $(XY)f\coloneqq X(Yf)$ is smooth and $\mathbb{R}$-linear, but not a derivation.
Thus define the *Lie bracket* $[X,Y]$ of $X,Y$ by $[X,Y]_{p}f=(X_{p}Y-Y_{p}X)f$.
Since $[X,Y]_{p}$ is a derivation of $C_{p}^{\infty}(U)$, we have $[X,Y]$ is a vector field on $U$.
