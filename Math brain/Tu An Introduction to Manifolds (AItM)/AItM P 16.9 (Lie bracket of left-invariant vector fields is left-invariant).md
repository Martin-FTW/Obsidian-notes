# Proposition 16.9 (Lie bracket of left-invariant vector fields is left-invariant)
Let $G$ be a Lie group.
Let $X,Y$ be left-invariant vector fields on $G$.
Then $\lie{X}{Y}$ is a left-invariant vector field on $G$.
Thus the vector subspace $L(G)$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{X}(G)$ is closed under the Lie bracket  $\lie{\cdot}{\cdot}$, hence $L(G)$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{X}(G)$.
#### Proof
Let $g\in G$.
Then $X,Y$ are $\ell_{g}$-related to itself.
Hence $\lie{X}{Y}$ is $\ell_{g}$-related to itself by [[AItM P 14.17 (Lie bracket of related smooth vector fields is related)]]
