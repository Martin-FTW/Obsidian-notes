# Definition (Topology)
Let $X$ be a set and $\mathscr{T}$ be a collection of subsets of $X$.
We call $\mathscr{T}$ a topology on $X$ if 
- $\emptyset,X\in \mathscr{T}$
- The union of any subcollection of $\mathscr{T}$ is in $\mathscr{T}$
- The intersection of any finite subcollection of $\mathscr{T}$ is in $\mathscr{T}$

In this case, we call $(X,\mathscr{T})$ a topological space and call the elements of $\mathscr{T}$ open sets in $X$.
