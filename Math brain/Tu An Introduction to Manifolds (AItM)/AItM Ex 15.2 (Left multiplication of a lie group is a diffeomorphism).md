# Exercise 15.2 (Left multiplication of a Lie group is a diffeomorphism)
Let $G$ be a Lie group.
Then $\ell_{a}:G\to G$ is a diffeomorphism.
#### Proof
Note that $\ell_{a}$ is a bijection with inverse $\ell_{a^{-1}}$.
Now let $\bar{a}:G\to G,\bar{a}(x)=a$ and $\mathbb{1}:G\to G,\mathbb{1}(x)=x$.
Note that $\bar{a}$ is smooth since on any chart it gives a constant function.
Also, $\mathbb{1}$ is smooth since on any chart it gives an identity function.
Now $\bar{a}\times \mathbb{1}$ is smooth, thus $\ell_{a}=\mu \circ(\bar{a}\times \mathbb{1})$ is smooth.
Since $a$ was arbitrary, we have $\ell_{a^{-1}}$ is smooth as well.
