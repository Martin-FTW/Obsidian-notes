# Theorem 19.1 (Comparison of box and product topologies)
Let $X_\alpha$ be topological spaces for all $\alpha\in J$.
By definition, the box topology on $\prod X_{\alpha}$ has basis $\mathscr{B}=\set{\prod_{\alpha}U_{\alpha}\given U_{\alpha}\subset X_{\alpha}\text{ open }\forall \alpha\in J}$.
By taking finite intersections, the product topology on $\prod X_{\alpha}$ has basis
$\mathscr{B}'=\set{\prod_{\alpha}U_{\alpha}\given U_{\alpha}\subset X_{\alpha}\text{ open }\forall \alpha\in J\text{ and } \set{\alpha\given U_{\alpha}\neq X_{\alpha}}\text{ is finite}}$.
It follows that the box topology is finer than the product topology, and the two are equal when $J$ is finite.
