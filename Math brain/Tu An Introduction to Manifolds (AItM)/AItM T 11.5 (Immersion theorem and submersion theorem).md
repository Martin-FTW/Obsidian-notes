# Theorem 11.5 (Immersion theorem and submersion theorem)
Let $N,M$ be manifolds of dimension $n,m$ respectively.
Let $p\in N$ and $f:N\to M$ be smooth.
1. If $f$ is an immersion at $p$, then $\exists$ charts $(U,\phi)$ centered at $p$ in $N$ and $(V,\psi)$ centered at $f(p)$ in $M$ s.t. $(\psi \circ f \circ \phi ^{-1})(r^{1},\dots,r^{n})=(r^{1},\dots,r^{n},0,\dots,0)$ in a nbhd of $\phi(p)$
2. If $f$ is a submersion at $p$, then $\exists$ charts $(U,\phi)$ centered at $p$ in $N$ and $(V,\psi)$ centered at $f(p)$ in $M$ s.t. $(\psi \circ f \circ \phi ^{-1})(r^{1},\dots,r^{m},r^{m+1},\dots,r^{n})=(r^{1},\dots,r^{m})$ in a nbhd of $\phi(p)$
