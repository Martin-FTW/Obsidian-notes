# Definition (Rank at a point for smooth maps between manifolds)
Let $N,M$ be manifolds and $p\in N$.
Let $F:N\to M$ be a smooth map.
The rank of $F$ at $p$ is defined as $\rank F(p)\coloneqq\rank F_{*,p}$.
If $(U,x^{1},\dots,x^{n})$ is a coordinate chart about $p$ in $N$ and $(V,y^{1},\dots,y^{m})$ is a coordinate chart about $F(p)$ in $M$, then the rank of $F$ at $p$ is the rank of the jacobian matrix $\displaystyle \rank\left[ \frac{ \partial F^{i}}{ \partial x^{j} } (p)\right]$
