# Lemma 41.3 (Characterization of paracompactness in regular space)
Let $X$ be a regular space.
Then TFAE:
1. $\forall$ open covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $X$, $\exists$ refinement $\mathscr{B}$ of $\mathscr{A}$ s.t.
	- $\mathscr{B}$ is an open covering of $X$ and $\mathscr{B}$ is countably locally finite
2. $\forall$ open covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $X$, $\exists$ refinement $\mathscr{B}$ of $\mathscr{A}$ s.t.
	- $\mathscr{B}$ is a covering of $X$ and $\mathscr{B}$ is locally finite
3. $\forall$ open covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $X$, $\exists$ refinement $\mathscr{B}$ of $\mathscr{A}$ s.t.
	- $\mathscr{B}$ is a closed covering of $X$ and $\mathscr{B}$ is locally finite
4. $\forall$ open covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $X$, $\exists$ refinement $\mathscr{B}$ of $\mathscr{A}$ s.t.
	- $\mathscr{B}$ is an open covering of $X$ and $\mathscr{B}$ is locally finite

Note that 4 is paracompactness.
