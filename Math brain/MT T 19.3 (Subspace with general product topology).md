# Theorem 19.3 (Subspace with general product topology)
Let $A_{\alpha}$ be subspaces for $X_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha\in J$.
Then
- $\prod A_{\alpha}$ with box topology is a subspace of $\prod X_{\alpha}$ with box topology
- $\prod A_{\alpha}$ with product topology is a subspace of $\prod X_{\alpha}$ with product topology
