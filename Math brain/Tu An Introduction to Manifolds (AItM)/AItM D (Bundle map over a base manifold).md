# Definition (Bundle map over abase manifold)
Let $M$ be a manifold and $E,F$ be vector bundles over $M$.
We call a bundle map $(f:M\to M,\tilde{f}:E\to F)$ a *bundle map over $M$* if $f=\mathbb{1}_{M}$.
Smooth bundles over $M$ as objects and bundle maps over $M$ as morphisms form a category, and isomorphisms over this category are called *isomorphisms over $M$*
Any vector bundle over $M$, isomorphic over $M$, to the product bundle $M\times \mathbb{R}^{r}$ is called a trivial bundle.
