# Definition (Finer, coarser topologies)
Let $X$ be a set and $\mathscr{T},\mathscr{T}'$ be topologies on $X$.
If $\mathscr{T}'\supset\mathscr{T}$, we say that $\mathscr{T}'$ is finer than $\mathscr{T}$ and $\mathscr{T}$ is coarser than $\mathscr{T}'$.
If the containment is proper, we add "strictly" before the adjectives.
