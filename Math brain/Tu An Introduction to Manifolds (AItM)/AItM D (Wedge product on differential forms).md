# Definition (Wedge product on differential forms)
Let $M$ be a manifold.
Let $\omega$ be a $k$-form and $\uptau$ be an $\ell$-form on $M$
We define their wedge product $\omega \wedge\uptau$ to be the $(k+\ell)$-form on $M$ pointwisely by $(\omega \wedge\uptau)_{p}=\omega_{p}\wedge\uptau_{p}$ [[AItM D (Wedge product on alternating tensors)]], we have
