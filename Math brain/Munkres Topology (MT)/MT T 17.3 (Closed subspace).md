# Theorem 17.3 (Closed subspace)
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$.
Let $A\subset Y$ be closed.
Suppose $Y$ is closed in $X$.
Then $A$ is closed in $X$.
#### Proof
By [[MT T 17.2 (Closed in subspace)]], there exists some $C$ closed in $X$ s.t. $A=C\cap Y$.
Now $C,Y$ are closed, thus $A$ is closed by [[MT T 17.1 (Closed set properties)]]
