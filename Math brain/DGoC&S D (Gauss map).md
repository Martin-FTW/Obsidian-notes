# Definition (Gauss map)
Let $S$ be a orientable regular surface.
By [[DGoC&S P 2.6.1 (Orientable iff a differentiable unit normal vector field exists)]], there is a differentiable unit normal vector field $N:S\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$.
We call $N$ an orientation of $S$.
Since $\norm{N(p)}=1$ for all $p\in S$, it is a function $N:S\to \mathbb{S}^{2}$ between regular surfaces.
We call $N:S\to \mathbb{S}^{2}$ the Gauss map of $S$.
