# Theorem 25.2 (Path components are path-connected disjoint subspaces that covers the space such that each nonempty path-connected subspace intersects only one path component)
Let $X$ be a topological space and $\sim$ the "path connected" equivalence relation.
Then $X/{\sim}=\set{P\given P\text{ is a path component of }X}$ consists of path-connected disjoint subspaces of $X$ whose union is $X$.
For all nonempty path-connected subspace $S$ of $X$, $S$ intersects only $1$ path component.
