# Definition (Basis orientation)
Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space.
Let $e=\set{e_{i}},f=\set{f_{i}}$ be two ordered bases of $V$.
We say that $e,f$ have same orientation of the change of basis matrix has positive determinant, i.e. $\det[I_{V}]_{f}^{e}>0$.
We denote this as $e\sim f$ as this is an equivalence relation with exactly two equivalence classes.
Each equivalence class is called an orientation of $V$.

In $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, if $\beta$ is the standard basis, we call $[\beta]_{\sim}$ the positive orientation of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and the other orientation the negative orientation of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
