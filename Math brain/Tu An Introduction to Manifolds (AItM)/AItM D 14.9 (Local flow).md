# Definition 14.9 (Local flow)
Let $M$ be a manifold, $U$ be an open set, $p\in U$.
Let $F:\opop{-\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}\times W\to U$ be a smooth map denoted by $F_{t}(q)=F(t,q)$, where $\varepsilon>0$, $W$ is a nbhd of $p$ in $U$.
We call $F$ a local flow if 
1. $\forall q\in W:F_{0}(q)=q$
2. $F_{t}(F_{s}(q))=F_{t+s}(q)$ whenever both sides are defined

Note that by the corollary of [[AItM T 14.8 (Smooth Picard-Lindelof with smooth dependence on initial conditions)]], any vector field $X$ induces a local flow $F:\opop{-\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}\times W\to U$, as the second condition is satisfied by the uniqueness corollary in [[AItM T 14.7 (Smooth Picard-Lindelof on autonomous system)]].
We call this a local flow generated by $X$.
Note that a vector field can be recovered from its local flow, as $\displaystyle X_{q}=X_{F(0,q)}=\frac{ \partial F }{ \partial t }(0,q)$
