# Definition 15.1 (Lie group)
Let $G$ be a $C^{\infty}$ manifold.
Suppose $G$ is a group where $\iota:G\to G$ denotes the inverse map and the  $\mu:G^{2}\to G$ denotes the multiplication map.
We call $G$ a Lie group if $\mu,\iota$ are $C^{\infty}$.

For each $a\in G$, we denote by $\ell_{a}:G\to G,\ell_{a}(x)=ax$ the left multiplication by $a$ and $r_{a}:G\to G,r_{a}(x)=xa$ the right multiplcation by $a$.
