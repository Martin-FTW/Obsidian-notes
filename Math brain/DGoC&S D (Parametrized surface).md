# Definition (Parametrized surface)
Let $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2}$ be open.
Let $\varphi:U\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$.
We call $\varphi$ a parametrized surface if $\varphi$ is differentiable.
In this case, we call $\varphi(U)$ the trace of $\varphi$.
We say that $\varphi$ is regular if $\forall q\in U$, $d\varphi|_{q}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ is injective.
Note that a regular surface is different from a regular parametrized surface, as the latter can have self-intersections in its trace.
