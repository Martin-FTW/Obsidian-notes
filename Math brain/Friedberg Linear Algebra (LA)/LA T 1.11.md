# Theorem 1.11
Let $V$ be a vector space with $\dim V<\infty$
Let $W\subseteq V$ be a subspace of $V$.
Then $W$ is finite-dimensional and $\dim W\leq \dim V$.
Moreover, if $\dim W=\dim V$ then $V=W$.
## Corollary
If $W$ is a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, then any basis for $W$ can be extended to a basis for $V$.
