# Definition (Compactification, one-point compactification)
Let $Y$ be a compact Hausdorff space.
Let $X$ be a proper subspace of $Y$ s.t. $\cl_{Y}(X)=Y$.
Then we call $Y$ a compactification of $X$.
Further suppose $Y\setminus X$ is a singleton.
Then we call $Y$ the one-point compactification of $X$.
Note the uniqueness up to homeomorphism of one-point compactifications given in [[MT T 29.1 (Characterization of locally compact Hausdorff spaces as the unique subspace of compact Hausdorff)]]
