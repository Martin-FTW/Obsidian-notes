# Definition (Dimension)
A vector space is called finite-dimensional if it has a basis consisting of a finite number of vectors. 
The unique number of vectors in each basis for $V$ is called the dimension of $V$ and is denoted by $\dim(V)$. 
A vector space that is not finite-dimensional is called infinite-dimensional.
