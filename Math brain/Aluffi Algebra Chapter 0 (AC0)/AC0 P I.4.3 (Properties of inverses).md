# Proposition I.4.3 (Properties of inverses)
Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a category.
Then
1. Each identity $1_{A}$ is an isomoprhism and is its own inverse
2. $\forall$ isomorphism $f$, $f^{-1}$ is also an isomorphism with $(f^{-1})^{-1}=f$
3. If $f:A\to B,g:B\to C$ are isomorphisms, then $gf$ is an isomorphism with $(gf)^{-1}=f^{-1}g^{-1}$.
