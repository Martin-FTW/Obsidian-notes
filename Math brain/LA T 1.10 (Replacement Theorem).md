# Theorem 1.10 (Replacement Theorem)
Let $V$ be a vector space.
Let $L,G\subseteq V$ s.t. $V=\span G$ and $L$ is linearly independent.
Then $\card{L}\leq \card{G}$ and $\exists H\subseteq G$ s.t. $V=\span(L\cup H)$ and $\card{L\cup H}=\card{G}-\card{L}$.
## Corollary 1
Let $V$ be a vector space with finite basis.
Then every basis for $V$ has the same number of vectors.
## Corollary 2
Let $V$ be a vector space with $\dim V=n$.
Then
1. Any finite generating set $G$ for $V$ has $\card{G}\geq n$.
2. Any generating set with $\card{G}=n$ is a basis for $V$.
3. Any linearly independent subset $L$ of $V$ with $\card{L}=n$ is a basis for $V$.
4. Every linearly independent subset of $V$ can be extended to a basis for $V$.
