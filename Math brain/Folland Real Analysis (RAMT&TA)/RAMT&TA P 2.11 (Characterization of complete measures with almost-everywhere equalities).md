# Proposition 2.11 (Characterization of complete measures with almost-everywhere equalities)
Let $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ be a measure space.
Let $f_{n},f,g:X \to F$ be functions.
Then TFAE:
1. $\mu$ is complete
2. If $f$ is measurable and $f=g$ $\mu$-a.e., then $g$ is measurable
3. If $f_{n}$ is measurable and $f_{n}\to f$ $\mu$-a.e., then $f$ is measurable
