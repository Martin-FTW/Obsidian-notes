# Exposition (Exterior power of cotangent bundle)
Let $M$ be a manifold of dimension $n$.
Similar to [[AItM D (Tangent bundle)]] and [[AItM Ep (Cotangent bundle, 1-form)]], define the set $\bigwedge^{k}(T^*M)\coloneqq \coprod_{p\in M}\bigwedge^{k}(T_{p}^* M)=\coprod_{p\in M}A_{k}(T_{p}M)$ of all alternating $k$-tensor fields on $M$.
The projection of the bundle $\pi:\bigwedge^{k}(T^*M)\to M$ is given by $\pi(\alpha)=p$ if $\alpha\in \bigwedge^{k}(T_{p}^*M)$.
Now let $(U,\phi)$ be a chart on $M$.
Then there is a bijection $\tilde{\phi}:\bigwedge^{k}(T^*U)\to \phi(U)\times \mathbb{R}^{\binom nk}$ defined by $\tilde{\phi}(\alpha)=(\phi(p),(c_{I}(\alpha))_{I})=(\pi \pullback \phi,c_{I})(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha\in \bigwedge^{k}(T_{p}^*U)$.
Now inherit the subspace topology of $\phi(U)\times \mathbb{R}^{\binom nk}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+\binom{n}{k}}$ to a topology $\tau_{U}$ on $\bigwedge^{k}(T^* U)$ via the bijection $\tilde{\phi}$.
Let $\displaystyle \mathscr{B}=\bigcup_{U\in \mathfrak{M}}\uptau_{U}$, where $\mathfrak{M}$ is the maximal atlas of $M$.
Then $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for some topology in $\bigwedge^{k}(T^* M)$ and we can give $\bigwedge^{k}(T^*M)$ the topology generated by $\mathscr{B}$.

Now with $\tilde{\phi}$ as coordinate maps, we have $\bigwedge^{k}(T^* M)$ is a smooth manifold.
A $k$-form on $M$ is a section of the bundle $\pi:\bigwedge^{k}(T^* M)\to M$, and it is smooth if its smooth as a bundle section.
The set of all $k$-forms is denoted by $\Omega^{k}(M)\coloneqq \Gamma(\bigwedge^{k}(T^* M))$
