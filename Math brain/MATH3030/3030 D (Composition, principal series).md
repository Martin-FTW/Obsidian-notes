# Definition (Composition, principal series)
Let $\set{H_{i}}$ be a subnormal series for $G$.
Suppose $\set{H_{i}}$ has no proper refinement, or equivalently $\forall i:H_{i+1}/H_{i}$ is simple.
- If $\set{H_{i}}$ is not normal, we call $\set{H_{i}}$ a composition series
- If $\set{H_{i}}$ is normal, we call $\set{H_{i}}$ a principal series.
