# Definition (Left-invariant vector field)
Let $G$ be a Lie group and $X$ be a vector field on $G$.
Note that for each $g\in G$, $\ell_{g}:G\to G$ is a diffeomorphism.
Hence the pushforward $\ell_{g}\pushforward X$ of $X$ is well defined as a vector field on $G$ by [[AItM Eg 14.15 (Pushforward by a diffeomorphism)]].
We say that $X$ is left-invariant if $\forall g\in G:\ell_{g}\pushforward{} X=X$.
That is ,$\forall g,h\in G:\ell_{g}\pushforward(X_{h})=X_{gh}$, or $X$ is $\ell_{g}$-related to $X$ for all $g\in G$.

In this case, $X$ is completely determined by $X_{e}$ since $X_{g}=\ell_{g}\pushforward(X_{e})$.
Conversely, given a tangent vector $A\in T_{e}G$, we can define a vector field $\tilde{A}$ on $G$ by $\tilde{A}_{g}=\ell_{g}\pushforward A$.
Since $\ell_{g}\pushforward(\tilde{A}_{h})=\ell_{g}\pushforward(\ell_{h}\pushforward A)=(\ell_{g}\circ \ell_{h})\pushforward(A)=\ell_{gh}\pushforward A=\tilde{A}_{gh}$, we have $\tilde{A}$ is left-invariant.
We call $\tilde{A}$ the left-invariant vector field on $G$ generated by $A$.
Denote the set of all left-invariant vector fields on $G$ by $L(G)$
The correspondence $T_{e}G\to L(G),A\mapsto \tilde{A}$ and $L(G)\to T_{e}G,X\mapsto X_{e}$ forms a vector space isomorphism.
