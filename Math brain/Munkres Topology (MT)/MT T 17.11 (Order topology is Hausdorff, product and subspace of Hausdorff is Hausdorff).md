# Theorem 17.11 (Order topology is Hausdorff, product and subspace of Hausdorff is Hausdorff)
- Every simply ordered set is a Hausdorff space in the order topology
- The product of two Hausdorff space is Hausdorff
- The subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff
#### Proof
Let $X$ be an ordered set with the order topology.
Let $x_{1},x_{2}\in X$.
If $\exists x_{0}\in(x_{1},x_{2})$ then $(-\infty,x_{0}),(x_{0},\infty)$ are disjoint neighbourhoods of $x_{1},x_{2}$ respectively.
If $(x_{1},x_{2})=\emptyset$ then $(-\infty,x_{2}),(x_{1},\infty)$ are disjoint neighbourhoods of $x_{1},x_{2}$ respectively.
